# EigenVector and Values,The Dynamic Duo to pay attention, if you are into AI ML and Analytics

When getting started with linear algebra, eigenvectors and eigenvalues remain shrouded in mystique for the uninitiated. While their behaviors govern the inner workings of matrix transformations, comprehending these concepts requires delving beneath surface explanations. However, a rigorous elucidation brings their mathematical elegance to light. 

Eigenvectors characterize vectors which, when subjected to linear functions, undergo a change of scale alone. Perpendicular to their initial orientation, they experience predictable alteration by a fixed scalar coefficient.  Yet behind this simple property lies deeper implication - they uniquely portray invariant directions under transformation. 

Complementing eigenvectors, eigenvalues quantify the scales imposed. As roots of the characteristic equation, their solutions emerge from probing the nullspace of differences between operator and scalar identity. Enumerating all possible scaling factors, they imbue matrices with dynamism rather than static quality.

Together, the eigenvector-eigenvalue pair divulges intrinsic qualities of linear mappings. Their theoretical relationship, emerging from rewriting the eigenvector equation and examining matrix singularity, endows novelty to other algebraic tools. Matrix diagonalization, long utilized for simplification, gains native meaning.

While initiation demands overcoming abstraction, rigorous treatment unveils elegance. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues, far from opaque, embody fundamental constructs with impacts across mathematics. Comprehension rewards application in physics, engineering and beyond.

Eigenvectors and eigenvalues, important foundations of linear algebra, embody fundamental constructs essential for understanding the essence of mathematical operations. Although a comprehensive examination of their intricacies awaits, a preliminary understanding of their conceptual significance lays the groundwork.
